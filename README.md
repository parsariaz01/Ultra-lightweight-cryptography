# Ultra-lightweight Cryptography 🔐  

This repository contains my research and experimental implementations in **ultra-lightweight cryptographic protocols** for **RFID, IoT, and constrained devices**.  
The focus is on **secure, efficient, and resource-friendly** primitives that can withstand classical and quantum attacks while being suitable for devices with very limited memory, power, and processing capacity.
